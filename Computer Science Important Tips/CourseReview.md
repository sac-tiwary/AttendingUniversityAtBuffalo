## Some reviews of subjects that my friends pursued.
__Reviews were given keeping the following points in mind:__
- why you took the course
- what you liked the course
- was it difficult or easy according to you
- what could be better/ what you did not liked
- who should take the course
- anything you can mention about the projects/assignments and the languages used in the course </br>

*Each review answers the above questions in detail.*

| Subject | Review from a student|
|---------|----------------------|
|__Reinforcement Learning by Alina__| Reinforcement Learning is the best course I have taken here at UB and I have taken various ML courses like Computer Vision, NLP, and ML. I say this because of following reasons - The courses' content and flow is structured beautifully. The difficulty always increases. The Prof. has made interaction in class fun. The only class where almost the entire batch interacted with each other. The projects are very interesting and structured. You won't have to worry about anything else except working on your project. Same with quizzes. The Prof. is super helpful and passionate. Her teaching exudes that. You can ask her anything. I liked the idea of reinforcement learning. The concept. That's why I decided to pursue it. The course was easy for me but you should definitely have the pre-requisites beforehand. namely, python, machine learning (somewhat computer vision). The course is not for someone who wants to take a job after masters. The future prospects of the course are purely research. Take it considering this into account.|
|__Parallel and Distributed Processors by J.Zola__| Took the course Cuz of the prof. I had talked to him prior to attending his class. He sold me on the course and the beauty of parallel programming . Also I was getting sick of all the ML/AI courses and wanted something different. Zola is a prof who enjoys teaching. He had the enthusiasm of a kid while teaching.And since it is a small class(only about 15 people) there was a lot of free-flow discussion. Definitely a difficult course. Exam questions are not straight forward. Requires you to use your brain. And the Prof does not give grace marks if you don’t do well. If you fail, you fail. That’s it. There is nothing I would want to change in this course. Maybe instead of 4 small assignments he could have given a project. But I beleive since it is a 600 course now, he is bringing in a project. This course should be take by anyone who is bored with shitty ML courses. Anyone who has an interest in parallel programming. Anyone who wants to learn about supercomputers and GPU programming. The major selling point for this course is that you do your assignments on UB’s HPC which is one of the country’s top High Performance Computing center. Seriously cool stuff. All assignments were in C++ . And they had to be run on the UB HPC which is seriously something cool to put on your resume. Assignments were really tough but you do get that satisfaction once you figure it out.|
|__Computer Security by Marina Blanton__| I only took the course cause I thought it will balance my course load. I didn't like the course. The course taught by Marina Blanton isn't tough in terms of difficulty, but it stupidly engaging. We had 7 assignments + mid terms + finals.|
|__Machine Learning by Mingchen Gao__| Took the course to better understand the implementations of mathematical models in machine learning. The emphasis on statistics/maths rather than programming was one of the best things about the course. The course would not be very challenging if the person has idea of basic statistical models and hands on experience of using python. Course should be taken by anyone who is interested in data science/analysis or wants to pursue there career in machine learning. the projects are pretty handy, the professor gives you only some instructions but most of the work of coding is to be done yourselves. It helps you inprove your coding skills. Python is the language usually used for any ML course|
|__Pattern Recognition by Wen Dong__| This course goes into the math and derivation of ML. This was a good add-on having taken intro to ML in the previous semester. I liked the professor. He did a good job explaining the concepts and was also happy to clear any doubts in his OH. The course will make you implement certain things from scratch and is def math heavy. It can feel a little difficult. However, the cutoff for A was super low. For the mid and final, he will have a revision and he will explain the kind of questions which will come in the exam. There is a lot to cover so he sometimes skips over topics. You will have to put in the effort if you want to understand. Anyone who wants to learn more about the math behind ML. This is a math and stats heavy course with proper derivations. They weren't too difficult. Usually took around a day. I wouldn't recommend starting on the last day. Languages allowed: python, R, and matlab Mid/final: open book. A little difficult but was graded leniently Misc: don't cheat. The bar for A is already low. Just finishing all the assignments and getting okayish marks in mid and final should allow you to get an A.|
|__Computer Vision and Image Processing by David Doermann__| One of the best course for you if you're interested in computer vision. It teaches you the basics. Took the course because of the professor. The projects were really challenging. Difficult, 100% heavy course. It had 5-6 quizzes, 5-6 homewoks, mid term, final and 3 projects. Course doesn't go into ML/DL much. It's just a basic image processing course and goes little into vision. If you're into computer vision, definitely take it. Quizzes and hws are all from what he teaches in class. Basic conceptual and numericals. 1st project was edge detection and template matching for texts with different sizes, background, color etc. You cannot use opencv. 2nd was image stitching from scratch. You can't use opencv library. Need to write code for feature matching, homography and ransac algorithm. 3rd was a group project of 2. There were many options but I chose the default one. Viola Jones algorithm for face detection. It's a pretty famous algorithm for face detection, you can find all the details online. You have to write all the code from scratch. All the codes were written in python. But we had freedom to use other languages like c++, java, c# etc.|
|__Analysis of Algorithms by Shi Li__| I took this course to brush up my algorithmic skills and to supplement my preparation for the coding interviews. Professor Shi Li takes great effort organizing and teaching this course. He teaches in a practical way, discussing the implementation nitty-gritties while teaching the theoretical algorithmic concepts for a problem. He conducts recitations himself where he discusses some interesting problems on each algorithm paradigm like Dynamic Programming, Advanced Graph algorithms. The problems discussed in the recitations are very similar to Hard problems on LeetCode, Hackerrank or other competitive programming platforms. The course is medium to difficult, particularly the exams are diffcult. The only component which makes me call this course 'medium' is the assignments. I think the programming assignments can be designed better. Someone who wants to brush up their algorithmic skills or get a deeper insight into algorithmic paradigms. Also for people who come from a non-computer science(non-programming) background in their previous degree or jobs. Midterm + Final is 60%, if you perform better in the final than the midterm, then final is considered 40%. Assignments are 40%, divided into two parts- written(typed) assignments and programming assignments. In written assignments, proofs and pseudo code is expected. For the programming assignments your are free to use any programming language of your choice, there are scripts to grade your assignments. No project component.|
|__Algorithms for Modern Computing Systems by Russ Miller__| I liked the concepts covered in the course and that inspired me to take this course. The algorithms were very interesting and there was a lot to learn. Moderate course. More practical projects maybe coulbe be better. If you’re really interested in algorithms. No projects/ assignments only exams.|
|__611 MS Project by Alan Hunt__| For depth level requirement. Well structured and well planned, similar to client facing projects in software development companies. Easy course. Anyone who wants to work with clients on some interesting projects and build a solution according to their requirements. mostly android/iOS apps.|
|__611 MS Project by Alan Hunt (New Grad's Perspective)__| Being a new grad. I wanted to get industry exposure and it is a perfect course for it. I liked how prof hunt handled the meetings it was very professional and it felt bigger than an academic project. It was challenging in a fun way. Industry requirements tends to change and it will make you capable dealing with that. We didn’t had demo day. I wanted to see other industry projects too. If you’re scared to work in industry try this course it’s a good hands on project. It all depends upon the company you’re working for and their requirements. There is no hard fast rule to use a particular unless you can achieve a task they are happy.| 
|__Modern Network Concepts by Lu Su__| I had to fulfill the requirements for taking a course related to hardware. So when comparing all the options, I found Lu Su’s course to be quite straightforward and easy. Since Hardware isn’t my forte, I decided to take the easy option out. I wouldn’t say there was anything special about the course. The projects were a bit interesting and you get learn about all the networking protocols and designing text chat applications. It was a fairly easy course. Any student  who just wants to be done with the hardware requirement and get a good score should definitely go for this course. The course schedule is a bit hectic. We had to do homeworks, wireshark labs and the projects. However the good things is you can work in a team of 2 for all of them. Projects had to be done in C/C++. The projects were a bit time consuming, but if properly divided with your partner it shouldn’t be a problem.|
|__Deep Learning by Changyou Chen__| I was interested in Machine Learning and many of my seniors suggested to go with the DL course by Changyou Chen. The course was structured really well but during my time the initial few classes were taken by the TA so just it would be better to talk with the prof beforehand whether he would be taking the classes or not. I found this course a bit difficult when compared to all my other courses. It was a bit mathematical oriented and one should be very comfortable with ML before taking this course. There was no midterm, so about 30-40% of your grade was dependent on the final exam. A major part of this course is dependent on the final exam and the project so there is a hogh chance of screwing your grade if you dont perform well on that ONE day. Students interested in ML shoudl definitely take the course. And Team Selction for this course is very important since you would be stuck with the same team menber for almost everything.|
|__Software Verification by Bharat Jayaraman__| This was new course covering content which we generally don't get to study. I enjoyed studying multiple tools to analyze the programs and make sure they are robust. Since the concepts are mostly new for all of us it became little difficult to understand and exams were difficult. Professor tried to ensure that students enjoy and learn the course. But it was offered first time in our semester so I guess it will improve more in coming semesters. Students who have interest in understanding the logics of verification which is way different from testing should definitely take this course. Assignment in this subject were all based on different languages and tools we study in  core cse. Some tools used were SPIN/Promela, SWIProlog, State Machines checker. But professor gave nice demo for all these tools in class.|
|__Analysis of Algorithms by Xin(Roger) He__| I took this course to complete my breadth requirement and also to learn algorithms as it is the heart and soul of computer science. I liked the course because it made me overcome my fear of algorithms and data structures. I wasn't very good at this earlier. This course was difficult for me initially but halfway through the course I started grasping the concept. I did had to put in extra hours of self-study to get a decent grade. I would rate this course as medium-difficult since a lot depends on the other courses you take when pursuing this course. If taking this course I will suggest to keep aside 2-3 hours a day for self study. It is at times hard to understand the professor's accent. I wish his lectures were recorded so that I can watch them at my pace. Anyone who wants to get better at algorithms and data structures to take this course. The professor is fairly friendly than others. There are 4-5 assignments on each topic and 2 mid-term and 1 final-term exams which are subject type exam(written exam). Even if you do not do well in one exam you still have scope to improve. Professor awards marks if you explain your approach well in bullet points and not really write the code which is a huge confidence boost. Assignments are meidum-hard and one must start working upon right from the beginning.|
|__Information Retrieval by Rohini Srihari__| I took the course because I found the topic and the project interesting. The course is very well structured and is probably one of the very few courses where everything is precises and concrete. There are 3 project assignments that also help in building the final project which building a search engine. Anyone who wants to learn about indexing, data processing, working with large dataset and wanting to have an impressive project on your resume should take this course. The project is based on Python and will give you good hands on the language. There are 2 mid-terms and 1 final-terms also which are MCQ based. Exams are very in-between the lines so reading the suggested book by the professor is a must. All lectures are recorded which is a good thing. All in all a medium course from which you can learn a lot about NLP and Text Mining basics.|
|__Blockchain by Bina Ramamurthy__| I took the course because I am interested in Bitcoins and wanted to learn more about how a decentralized system works and how to build one. The course covers material designed specifically for beginners in this field. There were multiple hands-on sessions where the students were able to transact with one another using Ethereum. Professor Bina encourages active participation during classes ensuring that students understand the concepts through hands-on experience. The students create their own cryptocurrency wallet, get ethereum and interact with multiple applications by carrying out transactions with other users.The projects are well designed. It gives students a lot of freedom to come up with their own ideas for the project and build an end-to-end decentralized system. Theoretically, the course introduces a lot of new concepts in the beginning which might be overwhelming, however, the course itself is not that difficult. In terms of projects, it helps if students have familiarity with Javascript. This course uses Solidity for the back-end (which has structure similar to Javascript) and Javascript for the front-end. However, there is ample time throughout the course for the students to pick up these skills. Due to the learning curve, it is sometimes difficult to cope up with what is being taught in the class. However, there are youtube tutorials which can help students when working on the projects and Professor Bina's "Blockchain in Action" book is very well written. It is available on manning.com and new users get 500 tokens to unlock new chapters. There is only one course available for Blockchain at UB. So, if you want to continue in this field, then you will have to learn the advance concepts by yourself. Blockchain is an entirely new domain. Take this course only if you are interested in learning something new. Don't expect to use it in your mainstream projects. Companies will adopt blockchain sooner or later, but they are still not there yet, so naturally, only a limited number of job openings are available in this field. However, there is a lot of scope for innovation so if you are creative enough, then this field can provide you with a lot of opportunities for growth. The languages used in this course are Solidity and Javascript.For the projects, you will be given the freedom to pick an idea of your choice and build an end-to-end application. The projects are not that difficult and usually you will be able to work in groups of 2.There are a decent number of tutorials online which will be helpful for the projects.|
